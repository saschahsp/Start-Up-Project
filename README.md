# Start-Up-Project-
Prediction of Acquisition of Start-ups

The data was extracted from Crunchbase on February 2014. The dataset provides information about startup companies, investment, and acquisitions via Crunchbase.

Multiple supervised learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Neural Networks are applied after intense data preparation. Validation shows that Neural Networks has the best performance in this case.

With the results of this project existing startups can evaluate their performance in order to discover their probability to be acquired and emerging startups can use the outcomes as a guideline for how to structure their company or which features to emphasize while going down the path of an emerging startup.
